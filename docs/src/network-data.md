# GasModels Network Data Format

## The Network Data Dictionary

Internally GasModels utilizes a dictionary to store network data. The dictionary uses strings as key values so it can be serialized to JSON for algorithmic data exchange. The default I/O for GasModels utilizes this serialization as a text file. When used as serialization, the data is assumed to be in per_unit (non dimenisionalized) or SI units.

The network data dictionary structure is roughly as follows:

```json
{
"name":<string>,                   # a name for the model
"temperature":<float>,             # gas temperature. SI units are kelvin
"multinetwork":<boolean>,          # flag for whether or not this is multiple networks
"gas_molar_mass":<float>,          # molecular mass of the gas. SI units are kg/mol
"standard_density":<float>,        # Standard (nominal) density of the gas. SI units are kg/m^3
"per_unit":<boolean>,              # Whether or not the file is in per unit (non dimensional units) or SI units.  Note that the only quantities that are non-dimensionalized are pressure and flux.
"compressibility_factor":<float>,  # Gas compressability. Non-dimensional.
"baseQ":<float>,                   # Base for non-dimensionalizing volumetric flow at standard density. SI units are m^3/s

All data is assumed to have consistent units (i.e. SI units or non-dimensionalized units)

The following commands can be used to explore the network data dictionary,

```julia
network_data = GasModels.parse_file("gaslib-40.m")
display(network_data)
```
