# Matgas Format (.m)

Here we detail the parameters that can be inputted using the matgas format. They can be inputted in the order they appear here, or selectively, in the case where some data is not required, by using the following header format.

```matlab
%% junction data
% id p_min p_max p_nominal junction_type status pipeline_name edi_id lat lon
```

See case files in `test/data/matgas` or `examples/data/matgas` for examples of file syntax.

## Junctions (mgc.junction)

These components model “point” locations in the system, i.e. locations of withdrawal or injection, or simply connection points between pipes. Each junction may have multiple pipes attached.

## Transfers (mgc.transfer)

These components model interconnects, i.e. points in the network that can act both as a receipt point or delivery point at different times of the day (redundant for steady-state). In practice, a transfer could be modeled as a receipt point and a delivery point, however, modeling it as a transfer allows for explicitly stating that a boundary condition can act as either an injection or consumption--but not both.

# Transient Data Format (CSV)

The transient/time-series data will come in as one .csv file (comma separated format). The first column in the CSV format will be a time stamp in the date-time format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+HH:MM, where the +HH:MM indicates the timezone offset, the second column will be the component type, the third column will be the component id, the forth column will be the parameter name, and the fifth column will be the value of the parameter.  See below example for valid header names.
