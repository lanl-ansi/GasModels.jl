If the data is not time-periodic, then GasModels will try to fit a time-periodic spline to the data and then run the transient optimal gas flow problem. Notice that fitting a time-periodic spline for a non-time-periodic time series data would result in deviations from the given profiles and hence the argument additional_time can be used to pad the total_time with additional time to circumvent this issue.

In which case, the flow may only travel from the from junction to the to junction.  In certain cases, it may be desirable to specify a direction flow that goes beyond the physical characteristics of an edge. For example, while a pipe may be designed for bi directional flow, a user may find it useful to specify in case that the flow should be in \"reverse\" direction. For such situations, the key word flow_direction has been reserved to allow the user to specify a direction of flow, where flow_direction=-1 denotes reversal of flow, flow_direction=0 denotes unspecified direction, and flow_direction=1 denotes forward flow.
